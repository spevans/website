    <h1>Belkin F5U011 USB Ethernet Adaptor Linux Driver</h1>
    This patch adds support for the Belkin F5U011 to the catc.c driver.
    It is currently a work in progress and is complete except for the
    following issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Setting multicast mode and creating multicast hash. [FIXED]
      <li>Getting line statistics (Collisions, frame errors).
      <li>Changing the MAC address.
    </ul>
    <p>
      It has support for Ethtool ioctls. The patch is against 2.5.4.
    <p>
      This device has the same USB vendor/product code (0x0423/0x000a) as the<br>
      CATC NetMate device. However, even though this device is based on a CATC<br>
      board, the catc.c driver that comes with Linux does not work with this device<br>
      as it as a simpler device than the NetMate device. Unlike the NetMate,<br>
      it only appears to allow one packet at a time to be transmitted or received<br>
      to the device (the NetMate allows write combining to increase performance).<br>
      It also has fewer commands, no registers and no LED control.

      <p>
      NEW This patch adds a fix for the multicast hash code.<br>
      The code has also been better intergrated into the catc.c file<br>
      so it is a smaller patch. This patch is against 2.5.5.
